# Definition of Ready

A Definition of Ready lets everyone know when a User Story is ready to be taken into a Sprint. It does not need to be “100% defined” with all acceptance criteria, etc. but it should be “ready enough” so that the team is confident they can successfully deliver the user story.

It will save much time if each user story meets Definition of Ready before the Sprint Planning meeting, but it is also OK to work on the user story during the Sprint Planning meeting to bring it to Ready.

## Definition of Ready for a Sprint

* The Sprint Backlog is prioritised;
* The Spring Backlog contains all defects, User Stories and other work that the team is committing to;
* No hidden work;
* All team members have calculated their capacity for the Sprint;
* Fulltime on project = X hours per day;
* All User Stories meet Definition of Ready;

# Principles for Evaluating Pull Requests

### Everything should be well-tested with automation

The code doesn't have to be 100% covered by unit tests. But most of the 'happy path' must be covered.

Pull requests with large amounts of new and untested functionality *shall not pass*.

### PRs that are just submitted without any prior communication will likely be summarily closed

First of all, stick to the planning for the current iteration.
Probably there's already a lot of delicious tasks waiting for you in the project's Kanban. Always follow the plan.

If you notice that some functionality that should the subject of a fix or that should be re-engineered, or if you found the opportunity to implement a beautiful piece of code as new feature, you must first open an issue and bring it up for discussion at the daily meeting before proceeding.

Communicating intentions and stating problems in a proper manner is the best way to design a better solution for the task, but also, to avoid wasting development time implementing unnecessary stuff, and duplicated work.

### Maintainabilty > completeness

Do not add something that increases maintenance burden unless it is a very compelling functionality or an obvious bugfix. No one can maintain a system that is not fully understood.

Keeping things lighter and cutting off edge cases rather than adding [technical debt](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html) is the way to go.

### Don't commit random stuff

The PR for your fix or feature implementation should only contain code related to that particular and well-defined issue.

Do not try to fix or change random things that are not directly related to your task. Another developer working on a different problem could stumble on the same stuff and, bang! Duplicated unplanned work.

Remember, open an issue and talk with the team.

### Make it small

A small and focused Pull Request is what you want. This is the mantra!

You have spent days obscured by the clouds of the problem that you were trying to solve.

Now, that you can see the sunlight, you want to merge your implementation and look ahead for your next dopamine shot.

Now, from the reviewer perspective:

Some people like to do code review code in the morning when they get to the office, while others do that immediately every time the PR alert pops in the channel. Be aware of this in order to manage your expectations regarding the code review process. Furthermore, keep in mind that nobody likes to find an extensive list of Pull Requests to review, each one with a huge amount of code that they didn't write and that they don't fully understand. If you've fitted too much code in a change, even you might struggle to objectively describe what is in there.

Keep your implementations concise, and cater for the people which will review your work.

### Be logical with your commits

Well, be logical with your commits.
